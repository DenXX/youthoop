If this didn't happen, try to be one pass away; spacing is important in basketball, but don't be the one who is always in the corner. Nobody will make it fair for you if you don't take it. If you end up further away from the ball, don't worry, but also don't just hope somebody passes: cut, screen, maybe go for dribble handoff. On defense, challenge yourself by guarding the player who's always in the action, not someone hanging back. You don't want to put yourself in disadvantage by picking someone you cannot guard, but you cannot afford to guard somebody, who doesn't get the ball. Try to Spotlight Your Basketball IQ: coaches love players who make smart plays. Show that you understand when to pass versus when to take the shot, how to position yourself defensively, and how to read the opponent's offense. Making one smart play can be more memorable than a series of standard moves. IQ can be a skill that is harder to showcase and notice at the same time, don't hope coaches will know that you are a smart player.
